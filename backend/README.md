TypeScript Express backend.

### npm install

Run after cloning to install all node packages.

### npm run build

Compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript.

### npm start

Runs the JavaScript generated with npm build, for the production environment.

### npm run dev

Runs the dev server in watch mode, so any saved changes should be picked up automatically and the server restarted. Use this for development. You also shouldn't have to 'npm run build' at all when developing, this script automatically complies the TypeScript code in watch mode for you and runs the dev server.
